The Raspberry Pi camera module can be used to take high-definition video, as well as stills photographs. It's easy to use for beginners, but has plenty to offer advanced users if you're looking to expand your knowledge. There are lots of examples online of people using it for [time-lapse](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/6504), [slow-motion](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/6475) and other video cleverness. You can also use the libraries we bundle with the camera to create[effects](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4483).

If you're interested in the nitty-gritty, you'll want to know that the module has a five megapixel fixed-focus camera that supports 1080p30, 720p60 and VGA90 video modes, as well as stills capture. It attaches via a 15cm ribbon cable to the CSI port on the Raspberry Pi.

The camera works with **all models** of Raspberry Pi 1 and 2. It can be accessed through the MMAL and V4L APIs, and there are numerous third-party libraries built for it, including the [Picamera](http://picamera.readthedocs.org/) Python library.

The camera module is very popular in [home security applications](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5071), and in wildlife [camera traps](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4832).
