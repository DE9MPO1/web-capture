Our computers have become too easy to use.

Right out of the box, they're ready to go. No installing operating systems, no typing into a command-line prompt like in the old days. We don't even have to hit save anymore.

Most weeks, I'm the first to celebrate this and to say I miss nothing about the way it used to be. But not this week.

This week I've been using the $35 Raspberry Pi 2, a bare-bones Linux computer no bigger than a juice box. And I've rediscovered something I had forgotten: the thrill of tinkering with a machine and its software. Of course, that thrill is accompanied, from time to time, with the urge to take a baseball bat to an inanimate object.

The Raspberry Pi is the antithesis of our polished, hermetically sealed Apple and Windows PCs. Open the cardboard box and all you'll find inside is a green board covered with chips, circuits and ports. There's no keyboard, monitor, or power cord. There isn't even an operating system. And that's all by design.

It was made by a U.K.-based nonprofit called the Raspberry Pi Foundation to encourage today's children, around the age 10 and up, to learn more about how computers really work. Children today "have wonderful technology in their lives, but they are deprived of learning how it works," Eben Upton, co-founder of [the foundation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), says. So while every other electronics maker has been slaving away on ease-of-use features, Mr. Upton decided to deliberately create a computer that dials back the user friendliness.

After using the Pi 2, there's no doubt in my mind that it's a great way for children and teenagers to learn about computer hardware and software. It's also great for us curious adults who are interested in knowing more about the worlds of open-source and software coding, and don't mind typing arcane commands into a DOS-looking interface to get there.

But don't let that scare you. I challenged myself to see what I could do with the little thing and it put my problem-solving skills and patience to the test. Even if you're someone like me, with little to no computer coding knowledge, you'll be amazed by the number of things you can do with a $35 computer.

A $35 Linux Computer

My journey all started with gathering the right pieces to make the Pi my main computer for the past few days.

Not only doesn't the Pi come with an operating system, there isn't even a hard drive inside. There is, however, a MicroSD card slot. So I did what the very helpful Raspberry Pi websites and community of experts tell beginners to do: I bought a $10 card preloaded with Raspbian, a basic Linux OS optimized for the Pi. (You can download the free software and put it on a card you already own, too.) Later this year, [a new version of Windows](http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/02/02/35-raspberry-pi-2-mini-pc-is-6-times-faster-and-will-run-windows-10/) will be released for the Pi.

OK, so it costs a little more than $35. I also bought a $5 plastic box to house the board, a $13 USB Wi-Fi dongle and a $8 Pi-compatible MicroUSB power cord from Adafruit.com, a website that sells the Pi and a selection of hardware add-ons for it, and provides tutorials.

With those things, plus a USB mouse and keyboard and an HDMI monitor I already had (TVs work fine, too), I was up and running. To get started, I did have to type some text into the command line and go through some installation processes, but believe it or not, it took less time to set up the computer than to bake a real raspberry pie. (Even with a pre-made crust!)

Raspbian, which launched a Windows-style graphic interface once I installed it, provides a basic desktop and menu with access to programs and settings. Using the preloaded Web browser, I've been able to do most of what I do on my laptop--check email, Twitter, Facebook. I also downloaded the free LibreOffice suite from the preloaded Pi Store.

But don't tell my bosses: I took quite a few breaks from writing this column in Libre's word-processing program to build a virtual castle in Minecraft Pi Edition, which is included with the software. I've also spent some time making a little cartoon cat run across the screen in Scratch, a program meant to teach children and teenagers coding basics.

Not everything is as easy as pie, though. After spending two hours trying to get the sound up and running, I nearly popped open a bottle of champagne when I finally heard music. The quad-core ARM processor and 1GB of RAM, about the equivalent to the processing power in a high-end smartphone, did keep things running far better than I expected--more than six times as fast as its predecessor. But there were times when the system would get so bogged down, I had time to brew a fresh pot of coffee.

A $35 Smart TV Alternative

But the Pi doesn't have to live on your desk. I turned the little box into an alternative to an Apple TV or Roku with the help of Sam Nazarko, who developed [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/), media-center software specifically for the Pi when he was in high school.

After installing the free software, I plugged the box into my TV and downloaded a compatible wireless remote-control app on my phone. It wasn't long before I was sitting on the couch, watching YouTube videos and even streaming videos from my iPhone to my TV using AirPlay. Since the Pi can playback full-screen 1080p video, it is great for playing video you store on a local hard drive, too.

OSMC has a number of streaming video and music channels, including Pandora, Rdio, ESPN, TED Talks and a selection of news channels. But it lacks the big services, including Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. Even accessing those through a browser is hard with the lack of Linux support for different video playback software.

A $35 DIY Gadget

The popularity and price of the Pi means that more and more people are using it to create weird and wondrous inventions. Some have made small arcade game consoles, printers, even Internet-connected dog feeders.

I wouldn't know where to start to make anything like that, but that's the beauty of the Pi's supportive online community of engineers. The most well-known, Limor Fried, known to many as LadyAda, posts written and video tutorials on various hardware projects on [Adafruit.com](http://www.adafruit.com/), which she started in 2005 to help those of all ages learn about making electronics.

I was lucky enough to get a real-life lesson from LadyAda, who held my hand through a beginner project: creating a robotic, Pi-powered stepper motor that spins a small flag. We went through a few of the steps, including attaching a series of colorful wires on the motor to the Pi and reviewing the software code that controls the direction and speed of the motor. [(The full tutorial can be found here.)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi)

I'm not sure I would have had the courage to start the project on my own, but Ms. Fried's advice to beginners is to jump in. "People think these projects are really hard, but even if you don't get it right away, you'll learn skills you normally wouldn't learn, and hopefully have fun."

No, the Pi isn't going to be everyone's idea of fun. You can lose hours of your day just trying to accomplish the smallest task on a computer that is far slower than even the cheapest Windows PC. But for the adventurous--and patient--that time spent losing yourself in critical thinking and learning how those easy-to-use computers around us work can be incredibly satisfying. And hey, it's only $35--and unlike a real raspberry pie, it has no carbs.
