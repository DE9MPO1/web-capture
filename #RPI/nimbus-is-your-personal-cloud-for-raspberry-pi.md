# Nimbus is Your Personal Cloud for Raspberry Pi

_Captured: 2017-05-19 at 11:42 from [cloudnimbus.org](https://cloudnimbus.org/)_

## Private, Secure and Absolutely Free.

Designed to run on nothing but an external hard drive and Raspberry Pi, Nimbus is your low-cost, easy to use personal cloud. Store, share and stream your files anywhere without paying a subscription or worrying about the security of your files.

Nimbus isn't your run-of-the-mill cloud service. This is **your** cloud. Plug it into your router and access it everywhere you go, or unplug the hard drive and take your files with you on the road.

Easily share your files with optional password protection and expiration dates. Especially handy when files are too large to email.

Login to your cloud and listen to music, watch videos, and create playlists. The files you upload are automatically scanned and added to your media library.

Our desktop application automatically synchronizes files to Nimbus, and accross multiple computers. Easily store, transfer and back up files to your cloud.

All you need to get up-and-running is a $35 Raspberry Pi and an external hard drive of any size. Connect multiple hard drives to increase storage, and forget about cloud subscriptions.

Configure TLS encrypted communication for your cloud with a single command. Thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), free, automated, and open encryption is a snap to set up.

The desktop sync app has just arrived! Mobile apps broader platform support are on the way. Have an idea? Let us know about it [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimbuscloud).
