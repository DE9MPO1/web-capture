_Captured: 2017-05-11 at 22:49 from [skpang.co.uk](http://skpang.co.uk/blog/archives/1141)_

This project shows you how to setup Wireshark for use with the [PiCAN board](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-p-1196.html) to capture data on the Raspberry Pi.

Install the CAN drivers according to this:

Make sure the command line candump works first.

Install Wireshark
    
    
    sudo apt-get install wireshark

Bring up the CAN interface and start the GUI.
    
    
    sudo su
    
    
    ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
    
    
    startx

Start Wireshark, the icon is under "Other".

### **TODO:**

It would be nice if Wireshark can decode a list of PIDs.
