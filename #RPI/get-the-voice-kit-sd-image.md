You can view logs to get a better sense of what's happening under the (cardboard) hood if you're running the voice-recognizer as a service.

With the voice-recognizer running manually or as a service, you can view all log output using journalctl.

`sudo journalctl -u voice-recognizer -n 10 -f`

  1. Any lines before and including this one are part of the initialization and are not important
  2. Here is where the main loop starts
  3. Each successful trigger is logged
  4. Once a trigger is recognized the audio recording will be activated
  5. â€¦ and a new session with the Cloud Speech API is started
  6. For this a new token is generated to send the recognition request
  7. Same as line 7

  8. Same as line 7
  9. Back in the application, where we dispatch the command
  10. The command that has been dispatched
  11. The app is ready and wait for a trigger again

## Project complete!

You did it! Whether this was your first hackable project or you're a seasoned maker, we hope this project has sparked new ideas for you. Keep tinkering, there's more to come.
