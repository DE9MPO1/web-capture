As cool as it is, [the Raspberry Pi Zero](http://lifehacker.com/the-raspberry-pi-zero-is-a-5-computer-the-size-of-a-st-1744253282) makes some sacrifices to get so small. Namely, it doesn't have many outputs. But a few intrepid Raspberry Pi users have figured out ways to hack in a few of the more necessary components.

The Raspberry Pi Zero only has a single micro SD slot and an HDMI. Which means no dedicated audio out, no ethernet, and if you want to add a Wi-Fi, you'll need a convertor or a USB hub. However, Adafruit, RasPi.TV, and hackerspace ([not ours](http://hackerspace.kinja.com/)), have put together guides for fixing all of these problems:

  * [Add Wi-Fi](http://www.hackerspace-ffm.de/wiki/index.php?title=Raspberry_PI_Zero_%2B_nano_USB_WiFi_Adapter_mod): Hackerspace put decided to take apart a USB Wi-Fi card and wire it in to the Zero. You'll need some soldering skills but otherwise it's a pretty simple project.
  * [Add Ethernet](http://raspi.tv/2015/ethernet-on-pi-zero-how-to-put-an-ethernet-port-on-your-pi): Raspi.TV shows you how to manually wire in an Ethernet port to the Pi's GPIO.
  * [Add Audio Out](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-basic-audio-ouput-to-raspberry-pi-zero?view=all): Adafruit put together a guide for manually wiring in Audio Out into the GPIO (pictured above). You'll also need a breadboard a few other additional parts to get it up and running. 

There will certainly be more guides and more features added as time goes on, but if you've just received your Pi Zero, this should at least get you started.
